19807 ==sep== interesting how hilary is expected to contend with her husband 's faults . ==sep== 0
16231 ==sep== if the dnc didn 't collude with the clinton campaign and super pacs &amp ; defraud the american ppl perhaps ==sep== 0
23454 ==sep== that one time a couple of busters started yelling at the convention and were so numerous that they were drowned out by wifi hotspots . ==sep== 0

9971 ==sep== i think he forgot the ==sep== 1
25420 ==sep== surprisingly hillary has been silent on this and hasn 't called for a recount . ==sep== 0
21453 ==sep== the irony is strong with that comment . ==sep== 0
14475 ==sep== with such meaty material they may need all 35k working on it ! ==sep== 1
10351 ==sep== agreed . . . especially after the party treated him so well . . ==sep== 1

7458 ==sep== clearly their imprisonment was ok since it stopped those young black males from potentially committing crimes ! ==sep== 1
13381 ==sep== you have to consider the potential white male baby in their womb ! ==sep== 1
5921 ==sep== well what you don 't seem to undestand is mexican immigrants clearly have direct ties to isis ==sep== 1
14403 ==sep== who knew outsourcing your campaign 's it jobs to the geek squad would end so badly ? ==sep== 1
3195 ==sep== it was a youthful indiscretion . ==sep== 1
7459 ==sep== aaaany day now . ==sep== 1

20941 ==sep== more jobs and overtime for cop and asset forfeiture funds . ==sep== 0
16148 ==sep== so what 's your excuse for fox news ? ==sep== 0
13333 ==sep== because america only goes to war to protect the freedom and never for any geopolitical or materialistic reasons . ==sep== 1
17732 ==sep== hilary is an open vessel for whatever corporate /financial /military institution is paying her the most . ==sep== 0
20394 ==sep== easier to pretend this will just be 8 years of dumb sound bites and sexist tweets instead of actually causing the extinction of humanity ? ==sep== 0
7539 ==sep== which isn 't at all skewed by rubio 's race for president this year ==sep== 1
24036 ==sep== lol ==sep== 0

6130 ==sep== i 'm sure that evil muslim religion has provisions for skipping rituals when you are infiltrating the institutions of infidels . ==sep== 1
1352 ==sep== excellent idea because when clint eastwood talked to an empty chair no one thought he was going senile . ==sep== 1
140 ==sep== now now ; that sets a negative tone . ==sep== 1
18863 ==sep== tl ;dr : people who don 't agree with me on at least some issues serve no purpose ! ==sep== 0

13468 ==sep== omg i 'm shocked ==sep== 1
9085 ==sep== but it feels right ==sep== 1
3802 ==sep== how will we ever fix the problem if we don 't stop talking about it ? ==sep== 1
7249 ==sep== because everybody had a fair chance to vote in the primaries . ==sep== 1
3044 ==sep== like genna and tonic did in the bush years . ==sep== 1

19231 ==sep== or at least convicted . ==sep== 0
2034 ==sep== only after hillary releases her transcripts ! ==sep== 1
22047 ==sep== that link has absolutely nothing to do with trump . ==sep== 0
7054 ==sep== that was clearly people firing people to get financially ready for having a democrat president . ==sep== 1
7119 ==sep== i think that this is a pretty obvious ==sep== 1
24722 ==sep== hillary 's not the police . ==sep== 0
4485 ==sep== omg ! ==sep== 1
4263 ==sep== at least the deficit can 't get any bigger as long as the boner is in charge . ==sep== 1
11087 ==sep== but they 're our allies ! ==sep== 1
16788 ==sep== but the interests of the economy and the interests of the environment need to be balanced . ==sep== 0
22851 ==sep== rich ann really just isn 't cut out for this campaigning nonsense - ftfy ==sep== 0
7792 ==sep== america has great history of prohibition . ==sep== 1
11587 ==sep== i think he meant the generation that handed out the first ever massive tax cuts in the time of multiple wars while massive de -regulating led to the worst economic collapse since the great depression . . . ==sep== 1
2102 ==sep== but the teachers are evil . ==sep== 1
7235 ==sep== but trickle down economics dude . ==sep== 1
13035 ==sep== but . . . but . . . but . . . socialism ! ==sep== 1

5013 ==sep== it 's fine the dnc took money from downtickets during the primary to elect their queen and it totally didn 't bite them in ass ==sep== 1
15917 ==sep== well then goldman needs to buy a vowel . ==sep== 0
8885 ==sep== this will swing the election . ==sep== 1
12765 ==sep== that ought to stop all the bullet conspiracy theories . ==sep== 1
8259 ==sep== yeah bill clinton and ronald reagan were losers too ==sep== 1
4729 ==sep== but i thought all gun owners were uneducated hicks ? ==sep== 1
4500 ==sep== that was unpredictable . ==sep== 1
4597 ==sep== you forgot this ==sep== 1
4110 ==sep== can 't we send the people who think taxes are robbing them to special communities where nothing is paid for and there is no law and order . ==sep== 1
5260 ==sep== as if receiving $153 million from special interests would have any impact on your decisions . ==sep== 1
24840 ==sep== i think we 're almost there after the last 3 election cycles . ==sep== 0
10529 ==sep== those sheep ==sep== 1
13739 ==sep== he 's obviously lazy . ==sep== 1
3939 ==sep== but only white people care about economic security ! ==sep== 1
18523 ==sep== that is because trump kept spouting bullshit . ==sep== 0
20126 ==sep== there have been some suggestions that he is actually an atheist because of some of his stances but there has never been enough evidence to back it up . ==sep== 0
21257 ==sep== you 're just jealous you didn 't think of it . . . ==sep== 0
8717 ==sep== thoughtful comment ==sep== 1

20979 ==sep== so what ? ==sep== 0
1021 ==sep== i 'd love to break my gop addiction but my need for hating mexicans keeps me hooked . ==sep== 1
14506 ==sep== and besides that somebody somewhere probably did something even worse . ==sep== 1
