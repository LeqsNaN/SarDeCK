25611 ==sep== so you like everything about her . ==sep== 0

3462 ==sep== so trump is a job creator . ==sep== 1
5134 ==sep== you would make a great group team member . ==sep== 1

12460 ==sep== the tech who did the dna testing died in a suspicious car wreck weeks after completing the test . ==sep== 1
3339 ==sep== but no controls on investment banks that say they are trusted advisors and advise these to take flyers on these crazy investment vehicles ? ==sep== 1
25708 ==sep== clearly she is not transparent . . i don 't like or trust her . . . but shouldn 't we have a reference point to know if her behavior regarding press conferences is abnormal or not ? ==sep== 0
24080 ==sep== it isn 't her presidential campaign ? ==sep== 0
10896 ==sep== what a surprise ! ==sep== 1
4596 ==sep== because she 's a woman in a system dominated by men obviously . ==sep== 1
16210 ==sep== when trump is involved the safe money is betting that he is the one lying . ==sep== 0
13034 ==sep== that just proves trump was smart and ahead of his time . ==sep== 1
10596 ==sep== but hillary is controlled by the saudi 's who donate to charities across the world in record numbers so she is worse ==sep== 1
25991 ==sep== it 's like there are a ton of people who like him or something . ==sep== 0
12607 ==sep== its just the market dictating wages . ==sep== 1

14500 ==sep== i was going to correct you and say that it was george w bush that appointed chief justice roberts but then realized you were ==sep== 1
5174 ==sep== obviously this man was paid by hillary supporters to make trump look bad . ==sep== 1
15480 ==sep== you have a source ? ==sep== 0
8159 ==sep== but breitbart is the most unbiased news source out there all the others are controlled by the libtards and are all in favor of hillary obviously you are libruhl too because thats just objective fact ==sep== 1
14703 ==sep== but then no one gets to feel smugly superior ==sep== 1
6146 ==sep== it is an evil plan for the repetitive posts to build apathy ==sep== 1
6474 ==sep== talk like this is why trump won ! ==sep== 1
14579 ==sep== i think reagan and romney used the same line of reasoning . ==sep== 1
19023 ==sep== amazingly he is achieving that before ever taking office . ==sep== 0
1676 ==sep== like fox ? ==sep== 1

6882 ==sep== ya -huh . . . that 's totally what liberals think ==sep== 1
14280 ==sep== they never were before ! ==sep== 1
17718 ==sep== i think even just automatic registration would do a lot of good but the republicans for some reason don 't like it when more people vote . ==sep== 0
14049 ==sep== and that 's why the good people of la and ny should protect their 2nd amendment right to carry concealed nukes . ==sep== 1
656 ==sep== because the media that was colluding with the dnc said so ! ==sep== 1
4531 ==sep== because democrats never do that . ==sep== 1
24144 ==sep== back to this faux scandal again are we ? ==sep== 0
2727 ==sep== but her red powersuit makes me so angry ! ==sep== 1
2001 ==sep== by admitting that racism is still alive ==sep== 1

16036 ==sep== too much benefit of the doubt : typo rather than illiteracy . ==sep== 0
1078 ==sep== clearly these pussy russians are too weak for nuclear warfare under hillary 's command ==sep== 1

1368 ==sep== we have sanctuary cities to keep tabs on them . ==sep== 1
9938 ==sep== must be since trump started mentioning them ==sep== 1

10044 ==sep== the speechwriter is actually a shillary supporter duh ==sep== 1
6293 ==sep== well that solves it megyn kelly is clearly a liberal shill ! ==sep== 1
10707 ==sep== it 's to enhance our freedom of speech ==sep== 1
9763 ==sep== just doesn 't happen and anyone who thinks that might be the case is just stupid and naive ==sep== 1
1539 ==sep== you just need to take the time to get informed . ==sep== 1
25437 ==sep== we are almost reaching a british mp level of banter almost ==sep== 0

23265 ==sep== access is not an emotional issue if you are a wheelchair user . ==sep== 0
853 ==sep== well then china . . . thanks for all the hard work at reducing emissions ==sep== 1
14352 ==sep== this is obviously a false flag to shame them into silence . ==sep== 1
3666 ==sep== spoken like a true leader of the people ==sep== 1

20314 ==sep== low energy nazi pledge . ==sep== 0
9415 ==sep== they must be working very hard ==sep== 1

14143 ==sep== the nfl obviously wouldn 't have paid shills . ==sep== 1
5815 ==sep== shocking that an abrahamic religion has been in america since george washington ==sep== 1
676 ==sep== yep the only thing keeping people from voting clinton over trump is that they didn 't know trump was a climate denier ==sep== 1
12978 ==sep== but it 's totally wrong to state that republicans are a bastion of anti -black hostility because they have carson doing well in the polls ==sep== 1

13469 ==sep== all we need to do is further privatize education and the free market will sort all of our problems out . ==sep== 1
3880 ==sep== yes because the us has been talking about invading iran for years now . ==sep== 1
7155 ==sep== it 's super problematic to expect a woman to get up and field questions that she hasn 't consented to you shitlord . ==sep== 1
10827 ==sep== so military spending in the country to the point you take away from infrastructure and safety nets makes perfect sense right ? ==sep== 1
22249 ==sep== breitbart might want to tread lightly on accusing people 's campaigns of harboring moles working for foreign interests . ==sep== 0

21893 ==sep== why don 't you dig for the news reports and provide links since they were apparently all over the place ? ==sep== 0
1295 ==sep== gulliani the best ag hire by a president who promised to drain the swamp . ==sep== 1
14410 ==sep== . . .and jill stein would have won the election if so many were not discouraged to vote (or were just removed from the roles ) . ==sep== 1
7822 ==sep== because people that get divorced an have children deserve less rights than other people ==sep== 1
10531 ==sep== i just didn 't speak enough russian he later told reporters . ==sep== 1
3131 ==sep== because private for profit health care with insurance company death panels has worked so well for us ==sep== 1

3653 ==sep== that should accomplish a lot ==sep== 1
19148 ==sep== difference between pro -cliton and anti -trump . ==sep== 0
3498 ==sep== well how else do you explain his nationalized healthcare bill ? ==sep== 1
5064 ==sep== you forgot ==sep== 1
16693 ==sep== i wonder if all the trump supporters planning armed insurrection are just joking around . ==sep== 0
14025 ==sep== but remember both parties do it and are the same guys !1 ! ==sep== 1
17885 ==sep== i kind of like his routine stump speech right now . . . ==sep== 0
16203 ==sep== quite possibly . ==sep== 0

25083 ==sep== probably took a perfectly good sks and re -stocked it in some cheap black plastic chinese made stock meant to look like an ar with shitty after market removable mags and tons of gay addons ==sep== 0
11812 ==sep== i never realized that about the 1st amendment . ==sep== 1
18000 ==sep== the scare quotes really add to your screed ==sep== 0

8860 ==sep== deport the mexican that made that ladder too ==sep== 1
455 ==sep== yeah losing your job and that 's it seems a reasonable punishment for making some false charges trying to destroy an innocent guys life ==sep== 1
401 ==sep== yes because people finding out trump 's people did this would have no backlash and would really boost them . ==sep== 1
2849 ==sep== good thing he runs such a tight ship . ==sep== 1
22853 ==sep== one is current news and the other is old news that a bunch of high schoolers just found out about . ==sep== 0

17290 ==sep== in what freedom chamber does someone live where they would make it illegal for labor to organize ? ==sep== 0
25168 ==sep== watching trump get triggered anytime someone opposes him will be something ==sep== 0

13159 ==sep== there goes obummer again stomping on small business trying to tell that what to do ! ==sep== 1
9314 ==sep== because obama 's stimulus worked so well right ? ==sep== 1

13878 ==sep== what a thoughtful retort ==sep== 1
11600 ==sep== this is why people voted for trump ==sep== 1
